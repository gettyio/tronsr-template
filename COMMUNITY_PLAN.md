TronWallet will fairly distribute the rewards of the TRON nodes it operates. 

90% of all rewards will be distributed to our community in proportion to all votes cast.

10% of all rewards generated will be used to support the development of TronWallet and its ecosystem, in addition it will be used to cover some of the operating expenses. 

TronWallet is a decentralized app intended to generate profits by providing a simple to use and powerful multi-chain crypto wallet using cutting-edge technologies and enabling the main gateway to Dapps on the TRON Network through out built-in Dapp Browser.
