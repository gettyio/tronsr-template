TronWalletMe will fairly distribute the rewards of the TRON nodes it operates. Our community plan is divided into 3 parts:

## 1. Before TronWalletMe Election as SR.
To become a Super Representatives (SR) we need to get into the top 27 individuals among the 127 candidates, voted once every 6 hours. Super Representatives play a key role in governing the TRON community by ensuring basic functions, e.g. block generation, bookkeeping, and obtaining corresponding earnings.

We will reward 200% of block generation in TWX to our users until we get into the top 27 candidates.

## 2. After TronWalletMe Election as SR.
80% of all rewards will be distributed to our community in proportion to all votes cast.

10% of all rewards generated will be used to support the future development of TronWalletMe and its ecosystem.

10% of all rewards shall be retained for use as operating expenses.

## 3. TronWalletMe Profit Coin Burn.
TronWalletMe is an open-source app intended to generate profits by providing cutting-edge technologies and DApps for the TRON Network.

20% of our profits will be used to buy back TWX at market value and burn them, removing the tokens from the overall circulating supply thus causing a probable increase in the value due to scarcity. This process will continue until 50% of all TWX are burned.
